## Lesson 4 - Introduction to PyTorch 

### Tnesor 
- A tensor is a generalisation of vactors and matrices.   
- PyTorch tensors are pretty much the same as Numpy arrays. They come with some nice benefits such as GPU acceleration.  
- The number of hidden units a parameter of the network, often called a hyperparameter to differentiate it from the weights and biases parameters. 

### PyTorch and NumPy arrays 
- PyTorch has a great feature for converting between Numpy arrays and Torch tensors. To create a tensor from a Numpy array, use torch.from_numpy(). To convert a tensor to a Numpy array, use the .numpy() method.
- The memory is shared between the Numpy array and Torch tensor, so if you change the values in-place of one object, the other will change as well.

### PyTorch Neural Networks 
- It is mandatory to inherit from nn.Module when you're creating a class for your network. The name of the class itself can be anything. 
- You can access the weight and bias tensors once the network once it's create at net.hidden.weight and net.hidden.bias.
- You'll need to sequence the operations correctly in the forward method.
- To make sure PyTorch keeps track of operations on a tensor and calculates the gradients, you need to set requires_grad = True on a tensor.
- When we create a network with PyTorch, all of the parameters are initialized with requires_grad = True.
